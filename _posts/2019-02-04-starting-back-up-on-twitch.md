title:  "Starting Back Up on Twitch"
---

I am finally getting back around to more streaming on Twitch. I originally took a break and tried out other streaming services and I didn't enjoy them as much. After that, I ended up moving to a new place across town and spent time adjusting. I picked up new games and systems. I play Diablo 3 on the switch and PC now. Diablo on the switch is pretty fun and hope to find a way to incorporate some of it into the new streams. Most of the time I will just be playing PC games.

Warframe has been taking up a bunch of my time and I do really enjoy playing the game. It is a little harder to take it seriously when you can technically buy whatever you want, but you are able to gain the ingame currency using pretty simple trading methods so I don't hate on it too much. I love being able to find new ways to synergize mods and use different warframes to complete some of the content you get towards the end of the star chart!

Anthem is coming out soon and really looking forward to playing it. I enjoyed the Diablo style loot and the fact that loot is hidden until the objective is complete. The game looks beautiful. The abilities and movement have a lot going for it. I also had some things I didn't like. I am hoping at launch with the raw mouse support flying and swimming will improve. I would also enjoy it if the PC port was able to get a little bit of love. No reason the gtx 1080 can't handle the game above 70-60 FPS.

Division 2 is looking great as well. I don't have much to talk about Division since the private beta doesn't even start until this weekend. The new Dark Zone structure looks and seems great from the game play. I am really looking forward to playing it and learning more about it. Hopefully they learned since the Division 1.8 update knock it out of the park!

I will still be playing Destiny and continue to evolve my characters and follow the story that lives within. I haven't done the last word quest or completed the new raid. I haven't even reached 650 light yet! I think this is great and constantly has something to do!

Here is to a new year of gaming and we have a ton of stuff to look farward to.
